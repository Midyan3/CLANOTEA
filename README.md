# CLANOTEA: Simple Note-Sharing for Students

Hey there! Welcome to CLANOTEA. This is a cool spot where students can easily share stuff like notes, videos, and pictures to help each other out. If you're curious about how it's built, you're in the right place because this is where I've put all the code.

I built this site using some pretty handy tools:
- **Dropbox API** (that's where all the files go, but it's a paid thing)
- **MongoDB** (this is where all the user info stays safe)
- **Express.js and Node.js** (they do all the heavy lifting in the background)
- Here is the link to signup https://clanotea-57b3fd39a762.herokuapp.com/Web.html

Right now, I've set it up so you need an ID to get in and use the site. But don't worry, I'm planning to change that soon. If you want to check things out before then, just send over a pic with a white background, and that'll work for now. Also, you might see a message saying you'll get an email after you finish signing up. Just a heads-up, that feature isn't working right now, so please disregard it.

## What You Can Do

- **Share Files:** Got notes or a cool video? Put it up here, and your classmates can check it out.
- **Keep Everything Safe:** All your stuff goes straight into Dropbox, so it's safe and sound.
- **Stay Organized:** With MongoDB, all your user info is neat and tidy in one spot.

## Wanna Try It Out?

If you want to set this up where you are, here's what you need to do:

1. Make sure you've got Node.js on your computer.
2. You'll need a MongoDB thing going on, too.
3. Oh, and you gotta have a Dropbox account (the kind you pay for. It goes for $20 a month but there is a free trial for 30 days).
4. Clone this repository to your own computer.
5. Use `npm install` to get all the Node.js packages.
6. Set up your MongoDB and Dropbox with your own info.
7. Start the server with `node app.js` or `npm start`.
8. Be sure to set up an API key for dropbox as well as have your Mongol DB set up and link to paste in code

And that's it! You're good to go.

Remember, I'm always making changes and trying to make things better. So if you've got ideas or if something's bugging you, let me know. Just open an issue here on GitHub.

Thanks for stopping by CLANOTEA!

P.S. Keep an eye out for when I remove the ID thing. It's gonna be way easier to get in.

Some previews. There are no classes in the files but are there on the website
